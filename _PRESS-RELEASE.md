There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

## Sub-Heading ##
  > This app connects concerned citizens to antidote carrying first responders to help prevent overdose.

## Summary ##
  > There are 52,000 overdose deaths in the US per year. It is the leading cause of death for people under age 50. There is an existing network of people who have the antidote and the training to administer them. Our app aims to empower these first respondents allowing them to respond real time to overdoses in their communities and save lives.

## Problem ##
  > the increase of overdoes rescue need is not matched with the existing resources of trained first responders network.

## Solution ##
  > we create hyper localization and real time connect between people with the resources to help and the people in need

## Quote from You ##
  > As the overdose epidemic worsens citizen first responders will need to step up to help already overburdened emergency services.

## How to Get Started ##
  >  Join the app as the first responder and optionally turn on your location beacon to people in need around you. Concerned citizens see the responder network in their local community and can reach out to them to retrieve the antidotes in real time.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Without _blank_ I wouldn't have known my neighbor was overdosing. I made it to her in time and saved her life.

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Be part of the overdose rescue network to be someoneâ€™s angel. Join now.
